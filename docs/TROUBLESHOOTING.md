# Troubleshooting

This document provides solutions to common issues encountered while using the Shruti app.

## Common Issues

**No pitch detected:**
- Ensure microphone permission is granted
- Sing louder or closer to the microphone
- Check if device volume is not muted
- Try adjusting tolerance to higher value

**Inaccurate detection:**
- Reduce background noise
- Sing clearer, sustained notes
- Avoid vibrato for more stable detection
- Lower the tolerance for more precision

**Octave errors:**
- PYIN algorithm minimizes this, but can occur
- Sing in your comfortable vocal range (80-1000 Hz)
- Ensure clear vocal onset

**App crashes:**
- Check microphone permission
- Ensure Android version is 7.0 or higher
- Try restarting the app
