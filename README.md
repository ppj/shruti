## Building the App

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or newer
- JDK 8 or higher
- Android SDK with minimum API 24

### Build Steps

1. **Clone/Open the project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/kansen
   ```

2. **Sync Gradle**
   - Open project in Android Studio
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete
   - Resolve any dependency issues

3. **Build the app**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

4. **Install on device**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

   Or use Android Studio's Run button (Shift+F10)

### Build Variants
- **Debug**: Development build with debugging enabled
- **Release**: Production build with ProGuard optimization

## Usage Guide

### Initial Setup
1. **Grant Microphone Permission**: App will request microphone access on first launch
2. **Set Your Sa (Tonic)**: Go to Settings â†’ Enter your Sa in Western notation (e.g., C4, D3, A#3)
3. **Adjust Tolerance**: Set tolerance based on your skill level:
   - Expert: Â±5-8 cents
   - Intermediate: Â±10-15 cents
   - Beginner: Â±20-30 cents

### Practicing
1. **Start Detection**: Tap the green "Start" button
2. **Sing a Note**: The app will display:
   - Current swara (S, R, G, etc.)
   - Cents deviation from perfect pitch
   - Visual needle indicator
   - Color-coded status (Perfect/Flat/Sharp)
3. **Adjust Your Pitch**: Use the visual feedback to correct your pitch
4. **Stop Detection**: Tap the red "Stop" button when done

### Understanding the Display

#### Pitch Indicator
- **Needle Position**: Shows pitch deviation (-50 to +50 cents)
- **Green Zone**: Within tolerance (perfect pitch)
- **Needle Color**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Perfect (within tolerance)
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Flat (below tolerance)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Sharp (above tolerance)

#### Note Display
- **Large Swara**: Current detected note in Hindustani notation with octave
  - **Mandra Saptak** (lower octave): `.S` `.R` `.G` `.P` (dot prefix)
  - **Madhya Saptak** (middle octave): `S` `R` `G` `P` (plain)
  - **Taar Saptak** (upper octave): `S'` `R'` `G'` `P'` (apostrophe suffix)
- **Cents Deviation**: Exact deviation in cents (+/-)
- **Confidence**: Algorithm confidence level (shown during recording)

**Example**:
- Sing low Sa â†’ Shows `.S` (mandra)
- Sing middle Sa â†’ Shows `S` (madhya)
- Sing high Sa â†’ Shows `S'` (taar)

### Tuning Systems

#### 12-Note Just Intonation (Default)
Standard Hindustani notes with pure frequency ratios:
- S (1/1), r (16/15), R (9/8), g (6/5), G (5/4), m (4/3), M (45/32)
- P (3/2), d (8/5), D (5/3), n (16/9), N (15/8)

#### 22-Shruti System (Advanced)
Microtonal variations for advanced musicians:
- Includes intermediate shrutis between main notes
- Marked with superscript numbers (e.g., rÂ¹, rÂ²)
- Useful for subtle raga nuances

## Performance Optimizations

### Low Latency Audio
- Optimized buffer sizes based on device capabilities
- Async processing with Kotlin Coroutines
- Efficient pitch detection algorithm (~10-15ms latency)

### UI Optimization
- Throttled UI updates to prevent frame drops
- Hardware-accelerated Canvas drawing
- Efficient state management with StateFlow

### Battery Efficiency
- Audio capture stops when not in use
- Efficient coroutine management
- Minimal background processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No pitch detected:**
- Ensure microphone permission is granted
- Sing louder or closer to the microphone
- Check if device volume is not muted
- Try adjusting tolerance to higher value

**Inaccurate detection:**
- Reduce background noise
- Sing clearer, sustained notes
- Avoid vibrato for more stable detection
- Lower the tolerance for more precision

**Octave errors:**
- PYIN algorithm minimizes this, but can occur
- Sing in your comfortable vocal range (80-1000 Hz)
- Ensure clear vocal onset

**App crashes:**
- Check microphone permission
- Ensure Android version is 7.0 or higher
- Try restarting the app
